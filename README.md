Project 1

  In doing this project I have made decent progress in learning how to make a webpage that is standards compliant and how to use GIT. I had never written XHTML or CSS before and tried to keep the pages basic so I could learn some of the fundamentals. I looked a lot at examples and at Site Point to get an idea of how to do some basic structuring that I wanted to do and believe I got a general idea of XHTML, CSS and Git and met the goal of project 1. 

  I created a page for my resume and then a page for my portfolio that shows a compilation of the work I did in an AmeriCorps position. I wanted to try to do two different pages but have them be able to utilize the same CSS pages. I think, although it is simple, these pages work together. I'm not sure if my structure will work once I want to try and do more complicated things with design, but I put in a number of classes with the idea that I could specifically reference certain parts of the pages in my CSS and have it be unique to that portion of the page. Perhaps I used too many classes, but currently am not sure if there is a better way to accomplish this. 
 
  I wanted to keep the pages simple looking for now, because I wanted them to look professional. I was concerned that throwing too much color at them without a better idea of layout may cause them to be cluttered or look unprofessional. Also, I wanted to play with the basic idea of writing XHTML and applying styles. I found by keeping it simple I was able to better see how the CSS worked.
  
  Using Git was a bit confusing at first, though I have a general idea of how it works now. Starting off it was helpful to have the instructions at GitHub. I think Git will show some challenges once I create branches and try to do more tasks with it.  Also, now that it is set up on my laptop and on the lab computer it seems easy at least to do basic commits.
  
  I think going forward I will try and use my commits more strategically. I was committing just as I got to a point of having a chunk of the page working and I think once I have more going on I could use my commits better to keep track of what I am doing. I was using committing as a way of saving instead of as a place I wanted to mark in history. I wouldn't necessarily want to revert back to the places I committed to and think I could do use that feature better.  

  Both the HTML and the CSS validate and contain all the requirements listed for project one. Both my sites should print in an okay way and appear on a Firefox browser. I think project one was a success and met the requirements.

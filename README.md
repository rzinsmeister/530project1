Project 1
	In doing this project I have made decent progress in learning how to make a webpage that is standards compliant and how to use GIT. I had never written XHTML or CSS before and tried to keep the pages basic so I could learn some of the fundementals. I looked a lot at examples and at Site Point to get an idea of how to do some basic structuring that I wanted to do and believe I got a general idea and met the goal of project 1. 
  I created a page for my resume and then a page for my porfolio that shows a compilation of the work I did in an AmeriCorps position. I wanted to try to do two different pages but have them be able to utlize the same css pages. I think, although it is simple, that these pages work together. I'm not sure if my structure will work once I want to try and do more complicated things, but I put in a number of classes with the idea that I could specifically reference certain parts of the pages in my css and have it potentially be unique to that portion of the page. Perhaps I used too many classes, but currently am not sure if there is a better way to accomplish this. 
  Both the HTML and the CSS validate and contain all the requirements listed for project one. Both my sites should print in an okay way and appear on firefox browser.
